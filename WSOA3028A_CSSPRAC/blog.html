            <p class="post-description">I am excited about the journey I am embarking on with web designing, nothing feels good than a good, functioning, and interactive webpage.  
                I know Rome or the best web pages like iPhone and many more you can find on web flow were not designed or built in one day, it took learning, understanding, breaking, frustrations, and lifetime errors, so I want to be patient with myself and try not to compare myself. And that is my goal for the course and my journey as a web designer to be patient and enjoy the learning journey.
                I want to also talk about Engelbart English- 1968- A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect. The keyword that stands out in the essay is augmenting meaning to enhance or make better. In terms of this essay, it speaks about how the research center was built to create better working abilities for humans with the computer and believed that it could lead to significant improvements in individual and collective intelligence.
                The essay in a sense Engelbart’s dream as to what he imagines computers to look like and work, it was a visionary work that anticipated many of the developments in computer technology and human-computer interaction that we take for granted today like the mouse and its course position on the computer screen, this design was made so that humans can easily direct the mouse to aspects you want on the screen as we know today, but back then they still had an X,Y design movement of the mouse. Engelbart must be smiling seeing how technology has evolved, from a touchpad mouse and even more AI such as chat GPT, Bert, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Amazon Lex.
                Before I close this week’s blog, I want to share my experience with GitHub, well funny story, or maybe just ignorance, I had GitHub installed for me last year for group work and it really was helpful in terms of sharing one file, updating it without any errors or faulty issues, we all had different roles, like animation, layout designing, and coding and we worked flawlessly.  But now because this was installed and set up for me, I have no idea how it works, and when we were asked to install it this year I downloaded it again because I forgot I had it.  Another goal is to learn how to use GitHub!  </p>

            <span class="post-date">Week 2</span>
            <p class="post-description"> Hypertext Markup Language, there is a 98% chance I will never use the full name ever in conversation. This week’s introduction to HTML was simple in terms of writing code and understanding what is written and what the output will be, I feel that maybe having a C# experience has boosted that understanding and I feel the language is simple in general. With everyday practice, I think I can know the terms and how to go on about HTML with time. 
                The reading by Lawson Bruce I did not really actively understand it, from the title it says why we should use the HTLM article over section but if I look at the function of a article and section they are sort of similar, an article is a way to organize content on a webpage and a section can be seen as a container for related content that is grouped together, they somehow do the same job? Right? Maybe the other can be of better use in terms of reading and organizing I’m not sure, I think what is confusing is the example laid out for me as the reader. So basically, I am not convinced that one is better than the other. 
                Without shifting from the text I want to talk about the video of how a screen reader user accesses the web, what I got from the video is that it is important for your HTML or any other language for that matter write it so it is clear and orderly so that when the computer or a screen reader user is activated it can read allowed code or layouts that make sense. Getting back to and linking the text and the video I am guessing html section makes reading harder or the lack of understanding in terms of breaking down between headings, articles, and their content.
                
                See you next week!</p>

                Experience With UI and UX

            <p class="post-description">The Norman Door
                I think this theory is a great way to introduce how user experience and user interface work in terms of any product really be it a door, a game, a website, and even clothing!
                It is important that the design of a product is not arbitrary and should always be clear as to what they do, when, and how, if a product fails to communicate that then it really is the designer’s fault and not yours as the user!
                This broadened my understanding of how important it is to remember as a designer and creator that what is in my head no one else can see or understand so I have to communicate clearly what my product or website is about and how it works, for example, if I have a button in my website, as per norm and learned convention the button should respond with whatever result I set it to. If the button does not interact in any way and it is just there for decoration, I have already failed as a designer and to please my client.
                
                Speaking of conventions, when I first engaged with Steven Mailloux reading about conventions and context I did not quite get how it was linked with UI and UX until some thorough thinking as to what exactly the text is about,  Mailloux basically says that convention is a tradition passed down generation to generation or from academics to academics, these conventions are practiced because it is what people are used to and how we do things till today and that breaking these conventions could break a cycle and cause havoc, because now for example if a button does not have a function anymore then what does it do? And how will users get used to this invention? In the same breath, he does acknowledge that context can change, like the time and evolution of technology but the change of convention should be adjustable and understandable to all, like the book/paper hypermedia by Maria Fischer and Andrea Muller, these have been evolved from paper to digital screen, same convention but different context.
                Good UX and UI are when there is an interaction between the product and the user. We are provided with four definitions as to what interactivity is, Aaron Smuts says something is interactive if it is responsive if a user clicks on X at the top corner of a webpage the X should respond by taking the user to the homepage of the close page. Lev Monovish says that interactivity should not be random, if a user clicks on X it should not then take us to the next page or open a new website. Espen Aarseth and Gonzalo Frasca simply say that interactivity should be effortless/ easy.

                Experience With Wireframes and UI


            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 4</span>
            <p class="post-description">It is every web designer’s dream to create the coolest and most talked about website by having all cool animation effects and unending pop-ups, but it is all for nothing if the user does not know the purpose of your website or even knows how to use the interface. 
                This week’s reading by UXPIN about the basic principles of user interface design made me realize the importance of planning before instilling in code, this planning process is basically drawing a blueprint on paper on how your website will look and work, it is also known as a wireframe.
                The wireframe will basically give you a guideline as to how the layout will look like and how it will work. This helps ensure that the design will be organized, intuitive and easy to use.
                By creating wireframes, designers can identify potential issues with the design early in the process. This saves time and money in the long run by preventing design flaws and usability problems that may arise later in the development process.
                Your design intention should speak for itself and be easy to understand, if your page needs the user to scroll up and down make sure you have something like a scroll bar or even signs that indicate up-and-down movement.
                Overall, wireframes are an essential part of the UI/UX design process. They help designers create a well-organized, user-friendly interface that meets the needs of both the user and the business.

                Experience With Interactive Media


            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 5</span>
            <p class="post-description"> This week I want to talk about my journey with interactive media as a course, firstly I knew what I getting myself to when I chose it so this won't be how surprised I am about the content I have been given, lived up to my expectations realistic and I am looking forward to more challenges.
                This week I want to talk about how stressful it was adjusting to the year and what led to the decisions I have made with the website.
                In week 1, Week 2, I was not present at school in all honestly, as a matter of fact, I was not registered due to circumstances I had no control over.  I tell you I was ready to encounter a full gap year, luckily, I had the support of encouraging friends and a great student representative council to assist me.
                So you can imagine after making up my mind about not going back to school and started looking for other ways to make my life less boring, to my surprise and the grace of God I receive an email that I can register for the year 2023
                I had to shift my brain from holiday mode to student 101 in a space of literally nothing, cos I was already weeks behind and had no idea how everything was structured. I felt a bit overwhelmed because there was already a lot done in terms of people posting their blog posts and others already having an idea as to what their websites will look like, on the other hand, I did not even have visual studio code installed.
                I spent most of weeks 3,4 and 5 catching up, familiarizing myself with the work, and finally brainstorming my website which is why you'll see that in the previous weeks, I don't talk much about the progress of my work.
                This website really decided to keep things simple and take things step by step.
                My first thought was what I want to see when I search for a website if it’s phones, I want the home page to be of the many gadgets I can purchase, and if its clothing should be of the latest fashions and style.
                So, I thought to myself since we weren’t really given a theme as to what our website style should look like I want people to get to know me and the things I like through the website, also whilst sticking to the brief.
                And that's when I decided on, tea.
                I have tea every single day if not twice, I enjoy tea, I have it with sugar and milk, or without sugar and milk because the taste of the ingredients just has an essence of peace and rejuvenation in it so i thought why not just have displays of tea all around while also portraying how simple my life is.
                You’ll see everything on the website is simple and to the point.
                And that is how tea makes me feel, at ease, and calms the noise around me.
                I hope you enjoy browsing through it.
                See you next week.</p>

            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 6</span>
            <p class="post-description"> This article got me thinking as an aspiring web designer that user experience is more than just animated scrolls, pop up-animations, and automatic text animation, it is about, and as mentioned in the article, beauty, aesthetics or art play an important role in the user interface, (“In the paper ‘Attention web designers: You have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression!’ (this issue), Gitte Lindgaard, Gary Fernandez, Cathy Dudek, and Judy Brown show how fast impressions of the visual appeal of a website are formed and how stable they are.”) I don’t think the article is saying you should be an artist to have an effective user experience but make your webpage in a way that is appealing, use colours, be creative.
                The article also mentions how user experience is about emotion and effect. (“UX takes a ‘human’ perspective. It is interested in understanding the role of affect as an antecedent, a consequence and a mediator of technology use. In addition, it is rather focused on positive emotions.”) 
                I believe a website acts or stands as the placeholder of viewing a store, portfolio or anything really virtually before stepping in physically, it is window shopping and taste of the actual product, so it is important that a website is easy to use, understand and navigate through as you would at a shop, if the user wants to look into high heels, is there a page for that in your store? And if they have further questions can they ask questions and receive an answer immediately as they would in store?
                These demands should be met to meet the total satisfactory of the user and have a positive user experience and not leave them frustrated waiting for the chat bot to reply or search bar unable to function because the website is only designed for computer and not mobile phone. The user will leave the website even if it has the likes Picasso artwork, if it does not meet their needs.
                Lastly, the article says user experience is about the experience. (“An experience is a unique combination of various elements, such as the product and internal states of the user (e.g. mood, expectations, active goals), which extends over time with a definitive beginning and end.”)  How do you want the user to feel during browsing through your website? You could have a product they show no interest in but have the user spend almost an hour on  your website, all because it gives them that excitement and feeling of being immersed by what is presented to them and interact with.
                
                Here is a mind map on the points the article makes about good user experience</p>

                Changes And Updates On The Website


            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 7</span>
            <p class="post-description">Building a website is no easy task, and as a passionate web developer, I recently underwent the exhilarating experience of creating my own online platform. However, the marks and feedback I received for my website left me with some valuable lessons. In this blog post, I would like to share my journey and the insightful feedback I received regarding three crucial aspects: semantic markups, headers, and image performance. <br>

                Semantic Markup:
                One of the main critiques I received was related to the lack of proper semantic markups on my website. It became evident that I hadn't utilized HTML tags effectively to convey the meaning and structure of my content. By not using tags like header, nav, section, and footer appropriately, I missed out on providing clear cues to search engines and assistive technologies. <br>
                
                Headers and Microformats:
                Another area that required improvement was the implementation of headers and microformats. The feedback pointed out that I hadn't structured my content using hierarchical headers (H1, H2, etc.) effectively. This led to a lack of readability and clarity for both users and search engine crawlers. Additionally, I overlooked the significance of microformats, which provide additional context to certain elements like addresses, events, or reviews. Their absence hindered the website's overall accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO). <br>
                
                Image Performance:
                The feedback further highlighted the need to enhance the performance of the images on my website. Images played a significant role in my content, but their sizes were inconsistent, resulting in slower loading times. This negatively affected user experience and could potentially discourage visitors from staying on my website. <br>
                
            
                Receiving constructive feedback about my website's performance was a valuable experience that helped me recognize the areas where I fell short. The importance of using proper semantic markups, headers, and microformats cannot be overstated, as they greatly impact a website's accessibility, search engine visibility, and overall user experience. Additionally, optimizing image performance is crucial for faster load times and a seamless browsing experience. Armed with this knowledge, I'm now motivated to revisit my website and make the necessary improvements, ensuring that my future online endeavors will be better equipped to meet the expectations of both users and search engines alike.</p>

                Changes That Were Implemented


            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 8</span>
            <p class="post-description">
                After receiving valuable feedback regarding the readability of my blog page, I decided to take action and make significant changes to enhance the overall user experience. Recognizing the importance of easy-to-read content, I revamped the layout to address the previous challenge where the text expanded into a long, thin block, making it difficult for readers to navigate. In this blog post, I am excited to share the improvements I have made to ensure a seamless and enjoyable reading experience for my audience. <br>
                
                
                To address the readability issue, I made the decision to introduce a new feature: a dedicated page for each blog post. Now, when users click on a blog title, they are redirected to a separate page that provides a more spacious and user-friendly environment for reading the content. This layout change allows readers to fully immerse themselves in the text without losing track due to the elongated structure of the previous design. <br>
                
                
                By implementing this new design, I have made significant strides in improving the readability of my blog. Readers can now focus on the content without any distractions, enhancing their comprehension and engagement. Additionally, the separate blog pages enable better organization and navigation, making it easier for users to find specific articles and reference them in the future. <br>
            
                
In the design section of my website, I received feedback highlighting two key issues: oversized images and difficulties in understanding wireframes, along with the tedious nature of scrolling to find relevant headings in my notes. To address these concerns, I implemented a revamped design approach.<br>

Firstly, I made the images scrollable and neatly arranged, ensuring they were visually appealing without overwhelming the user. This allowed for a more seamless browsing experience, as users could now explore the images without any hindrances. <br>

Secondly, I introduced a user-friendly navigation system by incorporating links for different design topics. This new feature allows users to easily select the specific topic they wish to read about, eliminating the need for excessive scrolling and ensuring quick access to relevant information. <br>

By improving the image presentation and implementing a convenient navigation system, I aimed to enhance user understanding and streamline the reading experience. These changes empower users to explore design concepts effortlessly, while ensuring that the content is organized and easily accessible, leading to a more enjoyable and informative journey through the design section of my website. <br>

                Reflection


            </a>
            <span class="post-date">Week 9</span>
            <p class="post-description">Throughout the process of improving my website's user usability and navigation, I am pleased to acknowledge the significant progress I have made. The implementation of user-friendly features such as dedicated blog pages, clickable links, and scrollable images has undoubtedly enhanced the overall browsing experience for visitors. Users can now effortlessly access and explore specific content, resulting in increased engagement and satisfaction.<br>

                However, as I reflect on the current state of my website, I cannot ignore the inconsistency in the structure, particularly concerning the side menus. While the majority of the site maintains a consistent design, two out of the five pages display different side menus. This inconsistency arises from technical difficulties, as attempts to implement the old menu code resulted in errors and complications.<br>
                
                Recognizing this inconsistency, I am aware that further improvement is required to ensure a harmonious and cohesive user experience throughout the entire website. Consistency is crucial in creating a seamless and intuitive browsing journey, and I am committed to finding a solution that aligns with both design aesthetics and functional requirements.<br>
                
                In conclusion, while I am proud of the progress made in terms of user usability and navigation enhancements, I remain cognizant of the room for improvement that still exists. I acknowledge that continued learning and refining of my skills are essential to create a polished and consistent website structure. By embracing this growth mindset, I am confident in my ability to tackle any challenges that come my way, ultimately delivering an exceptional user experience on my website.</p>
