        <p class="post-text">It is every web designer’s dream to create the coolest and most talked about website by having all cool animation effects and unending pop-ups, but it is all for nothing if the user does not know the purpose of your website or even knows how to use the interface. 
            This week’s reading by UXPIN about the basic principles of user interface design made me realize the importance of planning before instilling in code, this planning process is basically drawing a blueprint on paper on how your website will look and work, it is also known as a wireframe.
            The wireframe will basically give you a guideline as to how the layout will look like and how it will work. This helps ensure that the design will be organized, intuitive and easy to use.
            By creating wireframes, designers can identify potential issues with the design early in the process. This saves time and money in the long run by preventing design flaws and usability problems that may arise later in the development process.
            Your design intention should speak for itself and be easy to understand, if your page needs the user to scroll up and down make sure you have something like a scroll bar or even signs that indicate up-and-down movement.
            Overall, wireframes are an essential part of the UI/UX design process. They help designers create a well-organized, user-friendly interface that meets the needs of both the user and the business.
