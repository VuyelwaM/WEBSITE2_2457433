        <p class="post-text">This article got me thinking as an aspiring web designer that user experience is more than just animated scrolls, pop up-animations, and automatic text animation, it is about, and as mentioned in the article, beauty, aesthetics or art play an important role in the user interface, (“In the paper ‘Attention web designers: You have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression!’ (this issue), Gitte Lindgaard, Gary Fernandez, Cathy Dudek, and Judy Brown show how fast impressions of the visual appeal of a website are formed and how stable they are.”) I don’t think the article is saying you should be an artist to have an effective user experience but make your webpage in a way that is appealing, use colours, be creative.
            The article also mentions how user experience is about emotion and effect. (“UX takes a ‘human’ perspective. It is interested in understanding the role of affect as an antecedent, a consequence and a mediator of technology use. In addition, it is rather focused on positive emotions.”) 
            I believe a website acts or stands as the placeholder of viewing a store, portfolio or anything really virtually before stepping in physically, it is window shopping and taste of the actual product, so it is important that a website is easy to use, understand and navigate through as you would at a shop, if the user wants to look into high heels, is there a page for that in your store? And if they have further questions can they ask questions and receive an answer immediately as they would in store?
            These demands should be met to meet the total satisfactory of the user and have a positive user experience and not leave them frustrated waiting for the chat bot to reply or search bar unable to function because the website is only designed for computer and not mobile phone. The user will leave the website even if it has the likes Picasso artwork, if it does not meet their needs.
            Lastly, the article says user experience is about the experience. (“An experience is a unique combination of various elements, such as the product and internal states of the user (e.g. mood, expectations, active goals), which extends over time with a definitive beginning and end.”)  How do you want the user to feel during browsing through your website? You could have a product they show no interest in but have the user spend almost an hour on  your website, all because it gives them that excitement and feeling of being immersed by what is presented to them and interact with.
            
            Here is a mind map on the points the article makes about good user experience
