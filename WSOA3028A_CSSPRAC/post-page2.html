        <p class="post-text">Hypertext Markup Language, there is a 98% chance I will never use the full name ever in conversation. This week’s introduction to HTML was simple in terms of writing code and understanding what is written and what the output will be, I feel that maybe having a C# experience has boosted that understanding and I feel the language is simple in general. With everyday practice, I think I can know the terms and how to go on about HTML with time. 
            The reading by Lawson Bruce I did not really actively understand it, from the title it says why we should use the HTLM article over section but if I look at the function of a article and section they are sort of similar, an article is a way to organize content on a webpage and a section can be seen as a container for related content that is grouped together, they somehow do the same job? Right? Maybe the other can be of better use in terms of reading and organizing I’m not sure, I think what is confusing is the example laid out for me as the reader. So basically, I am not convinced that one is better than the other. 
            Without shifting from the text I want to talk about the video of how a screen reader user accesses the web, what I got from the video is that it is important for your HTML or any other language for that matter write it so it is clear and orderly so that when the computer or a screen reader user is activated it can read allowed code or layouts that make sense. Getting back to and linking the text and the video I am guessing html section makes reading harder or the lack of understanding in terms of breaking down between headings, articles, and their content.
            
            See you next week!
