        <p class="post-text">I am excited about the journey I am embarking on with web designing, nothing feels good than a good, functioning, and interactive webpage.  
            I know Rome or the best web pages like iPhone and many more you can find on web flow were not designed or built in one day, it took learning, understanding, breaking, frustrations, and lifetime errors, so I want to be patient with myself and try not to compare myself. And that is my goal for the course and my journey as a web designer to be patient and enjoy the learning journey.
            I want to also talk about Engelbart English- 1968- A Research Center for Augmenting Human Intellect. The keyword that stands out in the essay is augmenting meaning to enhance or make better. In terms of this essay, it speaks about how the research center was built to create better working abilities for humans with the computer and believed that it could lead to significant improvements in individual and collective intelligence.
            The essay in a sense Engelbart’s dream as to what he imagines computers to look like and work, it was a visionary work that anticipated many of the developments in computer technology and human-computer interaction that we take for granted today like the mouse and its course position on the computer screen, this design was made so that humans can easily direct the mouse to aspects you want on the screen as we know today, but back then they still had an X,Y design movement of the mouse. Engelbart must be smiling seeing how technology has evolved, from a touchpad mouse and even more AI such as chat GPT, Bert, Microsoft Bot Framework, and Amazon Lex.
            Before I close this week’s blog, I want to share my experience with GitHub, well funny story, or maybe just ignorance, I had GitHub installed for me last year for group work and it really was helpful in terms of sharing one file, updating it without any errors or faulty issues, we all had different roles, like animation, layout designing, and coding and we worked flawlessly.  But now because this was installed and set up for me, I have no idea how it works, and when we were asked to install it this year I downloaded it again because I forgot I had it.  Another goal is to learn how to use GitHub! 
        

            See You Next Week!
