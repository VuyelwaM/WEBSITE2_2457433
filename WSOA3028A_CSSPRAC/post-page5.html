        <p class="post-text">This week I want to talk about my journey with interactive media as a course, firstly I knew what I getting myself to when I chose it so this won't be how surprised I am about the content I have been given, lived up to my expectations realistic and I am looking forward to more challenges.
            This week I want to talk about how stressful it was adjusting to the year and what led to the decisions I have made with the website.
            In week 1, Week 2, I was not present at school in all honestly, as a matter of fact, I was not registered due to circumstances I had no control over.  I tell you I was ready to encounter a full gap year, luckily, I had the support of encouraging friends and a great student representative council to assist me.
            So you can imagine after making up my mind about not going back to school and started looking for other ways to make my life less boring, to my surprise and the grace of God I receive an email that I can register for the year 2023
            I had to shift my brain from holiday mode to student 101 in a space of literally nothing, cos I was already weeks behind and had no idea how everything was structured. I felt a bit overwhelmed because there was already a lot done in terms of people posting their blog posts and others already having an idea as to what their websites will look like, on the other hand, I did not even have visual studio code installed.
            I spent most of weeks 3,4 and 5 catching up, familiarizing myself with the work, and finally brainstorming my website which is why you'll see that in the previous weeks, I don't talk much about the progress of my work.
            This website really decided to keep things simple and take things step by step.
            My first thought was what I want to see when I search for a website if it’s phones, I want the home page to be of the many gadgets I can purchase, and if its clothing should be of the latest fashions and style.
            So, I thought to myself since we weren’t really given a theme as to what our website style should look like I want people to get to know me and the things I like through the website, also whilst sticking to the brief.
            And that's when I decided on, tea.
            I have tea every single day if not twice, I enjoy tea, I have it with sugar and milk, or without sugar and milk because the taste of the ingredients just has an essence of peace and rejuvenation in it so i thought why not just have displays of tea all around while also portraying how simple my life is.
            You’ll see everything on the website is simple and to the point.
            And that is how tea makes me feel, at ease, and calms the noise around me.
            I hope you enjoy browsing through it.
            See you next week.
