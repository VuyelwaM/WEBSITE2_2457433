                In the following essay, I will be exploring the <a href="https://www.emeraldcasino.co.za/" target="_blank">Emerald Casino Resort website</a>, reviewing its visual design, navigation, content, accessibility, user experience, ethical consideration, strategy and purpose of the whole website. But before that I will get into the theoretics of what is user experience and interface and why they are important, in this case on websites, to support my argument I will be referencing an article by Marc Hassenzahl and Noam Tractinsky; User experience- a research, a book by Steve Krug titled Don’t Make Me Think and lastly The Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett. I chose these readings for two reasons: they thoroughly emphasize and investigate the importance of user interface and experience and showcase the different elements that make up a good user experience. And because they are a fun read, using everyday objects and wittiness along the way.

            <p id="essay-text">
                It is every web designer’s dream to program a website with the best graphics, animation pop-ups, useful content, and the most used and talked about website, but it is also a user’s dream to click on a website, understand what the site is about an how to navigate through it without leaving them feeling distraught and confused by the overwhelming graphics, arbitrary functions and unnecessary data. And this is where user interface and user experience come in. It is very important when programming a website that you know who your target market is and use the appropriate strategy to use for the whole purpose of the website. The user interface is the first impression a user has with the physical components of a computer or any digital gadget, this includes a screen, a mouse or a keyboard. It is the introduction to how the user will use a website. Having the right user interface components like a working mouse, and an appropriate screen creates a responsive design, a responsive design is an important aspect of the user interface, it creates good user ability and functions well on all devices, accommodating desktops, tablets and smartphones. 

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A good user interface design includes good use of clicking buttons, menus that can take the user to their desired pages, conventional icons that people are used to like the symbol X is used to exit a page or cancel an option, and images that relate to the content being shown and does not overcrowd the page. There is no instruction manual to read beforehand, no training seminar to attend, no customer service representative to help guide the user through the site. There is only the user, facing the site alone with only their wits and personal experience to guide them (Garrett,2002). A good user interface design is important because it enhances the user experience, making it easier for users to navigate and use the website.

                The user experience is the website’s overall performance and how it leaves the user feeling. If something requires a large investment of time— or looks like it will—it’s less likely to be used (Steve, 2014). What makes a good user experience? In this part of defining user experience, I want to use the three elements that make up a good user experience by referencing Hassenzahl, Tractinsky in User Experience- a research agenda that talks about the research they have done on what makes good user experience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The first element is beyond instrumental, this element talks about how the design and aesthetic of a website play a huge role in the users experience. In the paper ‘Attention web designers: You have 50 milliseconds to make a good first impression!’  Gitte Lindgaard, Gary Fernandez, Cathy Dudek and Judy Brown show how fast impressions of the visual appeal of a website are formed and how stable they are (Hassenzahl and Trackrinsky,2006). This includes design layouts such as colour schemes, typography and images. A user can spend hours on a site they have no interest in using their products but because they like how it looks and how it makes them feel. In an early attempt to define UX, Alben (1996), for example, identified beauty (i.e. aesthetics) as an important quality aspect of technology. (Hassenzahl and Trackrinsky,2006). 


            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The second element the article speaks of is emotion and effect. In this section, they say user experiences are about leaving the user in an exciting or rather positive state, designers should avoid leaving the user confused or frustrated, and this can be done by keeping things  simple and navigations clear; the website should communicate a clear message and instructions to the user, the functions should work properly, having more features, however, turns out to be only a temporary source of competitive advantage. With the added complexity that comes with an ever-expanding feature set, sites become increasingly unwieldy, hard to use, and unappealing to the very first-timers they are supposed to draw in (Garrett,2002). If there is text space or a search box the site should allow the user to type in their desired text and not be limited by a gadget’s screen, it is the small things that can leave the user upset, overall, the website should feel like walking into a store, with labelled isles of what you need and an assistant nearby. A key aspect of UX is understanding the needs and goals of the users of the website. This includes identifying what tasks users are trying to accomplish, what information they need, and what their pain points are (ChatGPT,2023).  A designer cannot design emotion but rather they can at least try to programme a website that can build up to a positive emotion once the website is running.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The last element in the article that makeup user experience is the experience. This element speaks about the overall feeling of the user as they are using the website, what they are thinking of what excites them, what are they focusing on and how they are engaging with the whole product. In this view, an experience is a unique combination of various elements, such as the product and internal states of the user (e.g. mood, expectations, active goals), which extends over time with a definitive beginning and end (Hassenzahl and Trackrinsky,2006).  In the article, they say the experience is about the user’s situatedness and its temporality meaning the experience of the user will always change depending on the user’s location, social environment, current mood or mindset.  In the same way emotions cannot be designed so is the experience but they can use the relevant elements to create a positive experience. What I also think can create a good user experience is interactivity or feedback, when the computer responds to what the user is instructing it to do.

                In this section of the essay, I will be reviewing the Emerald casino resort website, exploring its user interface and user experience while referencing James Garrets Elements of User Experience and his Five Planes that build up and influence aspects of user experience. The user experience design process is all about ensuring that no aspect of the user’s experience with your product happens without your conscious, explicit intent. This means taking into account every possibility of every action the user is likely to take and understanding the user’s expectations at every step of the way through that process (Garrett,2002).

                Emerald casino resort is a family-friendly holiday destination spot, with different types of appealing accommodations to choose from, and adventurous activities to take part in and hosts more than just holiday itineraries but also weddings, meetings, and events. For people who have not had the time to visit this beautiful spot, the emerald casino resort website is a great page to site see what is in store. There is a lot to explore on the website but for this essay, I will focus on the homepage and the few pages it can take us to.  During our first interaction with the homepage, we already see that the site has a very clear strategy which is to book or set an appointment with the place because first hand we have a text section covering the main image of the site that enables the user to manually book accommodation for themselves. I do feel they could have used a more accommodative image as this is a family-friendly hotspot, but instead, they have images of a casino, yes, it is what they also provide but it does not showcase what Emerald casino resort is about as a whole, they could have put a collage of their services instead.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The homepage has about 8 pages that it can take you to, a page about the casino, emerald rewards, accommodation, conference and venues, restaurants and bars, resort experiences, what’s on and a contact section. This was well set out because the user can choose what they are interested in without getting lost in unnecessary data. The navigation is straightforward and satisfying to browse through because every page comes with clear information and relative images to showcase what is in store for that section and this is what Garrets calls the surface plane, On the surface, you see a series of Web pages, made up of images and text. Some of these images are things you can click on, performing some sort of function such as taking you to a shopping cart. Some of these images are just illustrations, such as a photograph of a product for sale or the logo of the site itself (Garrett, 2002).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The website is also adjustable to any screen meaning it can open on any smart device which is very convenient if you just want to browse through on your phone. Another great element the website has is the navigation through the pages, if a user goes to the accommodation page they can one, look into the different accommodations, their pricing and how heads it takes, two, they can manually book themselves into one on the section provided to them or contact the resort using the pop-up contact box, and three they can easily navigate to other pages including the homepage by clicking the pop-up menu instead of pressing the back key. This is what Garret calls the structure plane, the structure would define how users got to that page and where they could go when they were finished there (Garrett, 2002).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The website allows users to estimate how much a room would cost for specific nights, while also allowing the user to modify if there may be any changes in the booking, the website allows for log-ins so that it is easy for members or new citizens to keep track of their bookings or details. This structure is called the scope plane, The structure defines the way in which the various functions of the site fit together. Just what those features and functions constitute the scope of the site. For example, some commerce sites offer a feature that enables users to save previously used shipping addresses so they can be used again. (Garrett, 2002).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Lastly, we have the strategy plane, this strategy incorporates not only what the people running the site want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the site as well (Garrett, 2002). From the introduction of the website, the page produces a booking section and contact information meaning their goal is for users to book a place, whether it’s for activities, accommodation, or events their main aim is to have a conversion rate, which is the measurement of user experience and selling their product.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Overall, I cannot fault the website with anything, as it provides users with all they need, not to sound biased because it’s a favourite holiday destination. One thing they could add, it is not necessary but a 180-degree moving image so users can explore the areas being shown to them for a greater experience. In conclusion,  user interface and experience work hand in hand and they are important expect of a good website and satisfied consumers.
