            I think this theory is a great way to introduce how user experience and user interface work in terms of any product really be it a door, a game, a website, and even clothing!
            It is important that the design of a product is not arbitrary and should always be clear as to what they do, when, and how, if a product fails to communicate that then it really is the designerâ€™s fault and not yours as the user!
            This broadened my understanding of how important it is to remember as a designer and creator that what is in my head no one else can see or understand so I have to communicate clearly what my product or website is about and how it works, for example, if I have a button in my website, as per norm and learned convention the button should respond with whatever result I set it to. If the button does not interact in any way and it is just there for decoration, I have already failed as a designer and to please my client.
            
            Speaking of conventions, when I first engaged with Steven Mailloux reading about conventions and context I did not quite get how it was linked with UI and UX until some thorough thinking as to what exactly the text is about,  Mailloux basically says that convention is a tradition passed down generation to generation or from academics to academics, these conventions are practiced because it is what people are used to and how we do things till today and that breaking these conventions could break a cycle and cause havoc, because now for example if a button does not have a function anymore then what does it do? And how will users get used to this invention? In the same breath, he does acknowledge that context can change, like the time and evolution of technology but the change of convention should be adjustable and understandable to all, like the book/paper hypermedia by Maria Fischer and Andrea Muller, these have been evolved from paper to digital screen, same convention but different context.
            Good UX and UI are when there is an interaction between the product and the user. We are provided with four definitions as to what interactivity is, Aaron Smuts says something is interactive if it is responsive if a user clicks on X at the top corner of a webpage the X should respond by taking the user to the homepage of the close page. Lev Monovish says that interactivity should not be random, if a user clicks on X it should not then take us to the next page or open a new website. Espen Aarseth and Gonzalo Frasca simply say that interactivity should be effortless/ easy.
